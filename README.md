# Umbraco-Health-Checks
This repo is a collection of [Health Checks](https://our.umbraco.com/Documentation/Extending/Health-Check/) for Umbraco CMS.

To start with they will be Health Checks that I have built myself but going forward I hope to get PRs from the Umbraco community too.

To try this first one out, download the file [LoremIpsum.cs](/SEO/LoremIpsum.cs) and put it in your App_Code folder.

## Lorem Ipsum Check

The first check is for checking if there is any Lorem Ipsum Content in the website. It goes under the SEO category. It doesn't have any actions to fix it, it just alerts you to it so you can check on your site.
